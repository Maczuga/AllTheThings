TODO:
- flight masters (ticky - lack of API methods)
- calendar/events support (events must be hardcoded into addon - MoP API provides no key => name pairing)
- item "appearances" - switch logic to having item instead of appearance by itself
- legacy achievements are not that legacy (ulduar 10/25 from legacy to wotlk raids because it was replaced by timewalking achievements)
- mini list filter in settings not being saved
- more soon

FAQ:
- I do not plan to release a version for other expansion until the server I play on switch to this expansion
