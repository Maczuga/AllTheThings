It is covered in magical currents, giving it an unnatural sci-fi look--except in the protected Eco-Domes, which are lush green. Goblins and Ethereals have made outposts here, as well as the Burning Legion and Kael'thas' blood elves, with numerous Mana Forges across the region. This region has numerous quests that grant Aldor or Scryer reputation.|r",
