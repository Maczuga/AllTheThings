A small twilit field, bathed in a quiet dusk, the area is dominated by the great tree Aldrassil, which lies at the clearing's center. It has class trainers for all night elf classes. Another notable location is Shadowthread Cave, which lies in the region's extreme northwest. The area is ringed by mountains; the only gap is to the south, where the path headed to Dolanaar parts the mountain range.|r",
